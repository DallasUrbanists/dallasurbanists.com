*Dallas Area Transit Alliance*, or *DATA*, was formed in response to a wave of [city council resolutions](https://dallasareatransitalliance.org/posts/dart-cuts) aimed at reducing DART funding. Our organization represents all 13 DART member cities: Dallas, Addison, Carrollton, Cockrell Hill, Farmers Branch, Garland, Glenn Heights, Highland Park, Irving, Plano, Richardson, Rowlett, and University Park.

The idea for DATA emerged during a meeting on June 15, 2024, at Cole Park in Uptown Dallas, where approximately 15 people gathered to explore the possibility of forming an advocacy group. A second meeting on July 20, 2024, at the Metropolitan Building in Downtown Dallas saw over 50 attendees, during which interim co-chairs Tyler Wright and Connor Hulla were elected and our organization's priorities were set. Our organization’s official name was selected 5 days later after 137 people cast their votes.

As part of our advocacy efforts, Dallas transportation advocate Hexel Colorado started a [petition on Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/protect-our-public-transit-say-no-to-dart-funding-cuts), urging the DART Board of Directors to reject proposed funding cuts. Since its launch on July 16, the petition garnered over 1,160 signatures in two weeks. The petition called upon the DART Board of Directors to reject any proposals to reduce the sales tax contributions from the thirteen member cities.

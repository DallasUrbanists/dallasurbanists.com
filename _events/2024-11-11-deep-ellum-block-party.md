Deep Ellum is blocking off Elm Street for an all day party! Music, food, drinks, art, and fun all day in Deep Ellum!\
\
Roll up to the Block Party and we've got you covered. [RSVP here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://actionnetwork.org/events/deep-ellum-block-party-roll-up-dbc-bike-valet-provided&sa=D&source=calendar&usd=2&usg=AOvVaw3kCqNVej102SVDrjnMOLEX) to let us know you'll be there and to get a reminder the day before. The "roll up" or free meetup is for everyone that rolls through Deep Ellum. Whether you're on bike, skates, a scooter, or something in between, if it's people powered, we'd love to see you. Come join us at the bike valet station at Crowdus and Elm any time between 1-2pm and then leave your wheels safely with us and enjoy the block party.\

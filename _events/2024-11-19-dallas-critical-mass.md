Critical Mass is a global movement where people ride their bike together as a group to demonstrate the need to make space for bikes on the road. It happens on the last Friday of the month in cities around the world. Dallas Critical Mass leaves at 8pm from the Dallas Farmer's market.

This is a social, conversation paced ride. The ride always starts at 8pm at the Dallas Farmer's Market, but the ride leader and ending location changes each month. Check the Facebook group for details. Bring white front lights and rear red lights, a helmet, and water. A bike lock and other bike tools are encouraged, but not required.

This webinar will explore land use and zoningâ€™s impact on equity and affordable housing. The focus will be a case study of the process known as Cville Plans Together, and how Charlottesville, Virginia moved from controversy around the events of 2017 to plan for and implement regulations that support the development of more equitable housing options in the city. This webinar is presented in partnership with the Maryland Chapter of the American Planning Association and the Smart Growth Network.

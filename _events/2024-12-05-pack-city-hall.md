Show up and speak (in personal or virtually).

The City Plan Commission is considering updates to off-street parking and loading regulations in Chapters 51 and 51A of the Dallas City Code. Let the City Plan Commission know how removing parking mandates is essential to lower housing costs. We must prioritize context-sensitive travel demand management, multi-modal transportation options, and well-designed parking facilities. You do not need to sign up in advance to speak unless you plan to speak virtually.

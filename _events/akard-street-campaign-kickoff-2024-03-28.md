What's our next move?

Please join our campaign kickoff virtual meeting this Thursday, March 28, 6:00pm! This campaign is about more than just fixing one street; our mission is to establish a blueprint for anyone to launch their own campaign in their neighborhood. Tomorrow's meeting is for anybody who wants to either help make the Akard Street pedestrian mall a reality and/or wants to learn the process for fixing a dangerous road and stepping up where our city won’t.

## Agenda

Here is our [campaign road map](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNgGSLE0=/?share_link_id=395609819804) outlining events and actions between now and the end of our campaign. The kickoff meeting is your opportunity to make suggestions for our roadmap and timeline, and to volunteer for tasks on the board.

See meeting agenda below. Everything from INTRODUCTIONS to ROADMAP will be recorded and published on YouTube; we will not record the open discussion portion of the meeting.

1. INTRODUCTIONS
2. BRIEF HISTORY
2. CAMPAIGN PURPOSE — This campaign is not just about fixing one street. We want to fundamentally change the process of how things get done in Dallas. This campaign is meant to serve as a blueprint for anyone starting their own campaigns in their neighborhoods.  
3. GOALS
- Vision Zero: Build the strongest case possible for changing the physical design of the roadway and intersections of Akard Street to prevent further death and injury.
- Inspire Copy-Cats: Document our process and share history-in-the-making so that more people can learn to launch their own campaigns independently.
- Accountability: Leave no room for excuses from City Council by offering a complete solution on a silver platter.
4. VISION
- Vision for Akard Street
- Vision for Downtown
- Vision for Dallas beyond Downtown
5. VALUES
- Safety First
- Justice
- Evidence Over Fear
- "City of Many Hands"
6. ROADMAP OVERVIEW
7. OPEN DISCUSSION
8. CLOSE

I've modeled this campaign after [Strong Town's Crash Analysis Studio](https://academy.strongtowns.org/p/starting-your-own-crash-analysis-studio), a free online course teaching you how to "conduct your own studio and change the conversation about safe streets in your place." The course is easy for people without a technical background and takes around 2 hours to complete. You don't need to take the course to participate in this campaign, but I highly recommend it if you're considering launching a campaign!

Join us for our first event of the year, a bike lane clean up! Unfortunately, the bike lanes Dallas does have arenâ€™t maintained nearly as frequently as they need to be. Itâ€™s one of our asks for the annual budget and upcoming bike plan, but in the mean time, we can do the work ourselves.

We put out the request to the community for where to start, and the overwhelming response was the Commerce street bridge. Meet up on Saturday morning at the Commerce street bridge at 10am or gather at 9:30 at the Dallas Farmers Market to bike over together. If youâ€™re driving, parking should be available at the Trinity Overlook Park.

Weâ€™ll bring a few tools and trash bags, but this is a BYOB event (bring your own broom ðŸ˜‰). Thank you to Sam Cooper, our new board member and @white.rock.ramble founder, for leading this effort!

Chief Planner of Forward Dallas, Lawrence Agu, will give a short presentation on how Forward Dallas, the city's Comprehensive Land Use Plan, can impact housing in Dallas. He will also answer any questions we have. There are several exciting aspects of Forward Dallas that move the city in a positive direction on housing. If you aren't familiar with Forward Dallas, you can read the full plan here.

We will also discuss plans to go speak in person to City Plan Commission about Forward Dallas. You should also send a letter to the City Plan Commission members here!

Once you RSVP here, you will get the Zoom link. And we will also email out a reminder with the link of the day of the event.

Build a Better Block is a community-driven urban design organization that specializes in transforming underutilized or overlooked public spaces into vibrant, people-centered areas. Through a 120-day collaboration and design process, they help communities revitalize entire blocks by prioritizing social infrastructure and public engagement. With a focus on placemaking, Build a Better Block leads 10 major projects annually, with spots available for 2025.

In addition to full-scale projects, Build a Better Block offers "Better Block in a Box," a customizable solution that includes shipping containers filled with street furniture and guides for activating spaces. This mobile kit allows for flexible, event-based placemaking efforts.

The organizationâ€™s work is rooted in the belief that when people are prioritized over cars, communities experience positive social and economic outcomes. Studies show that stronger social networks, lower crime rates, and higher civic participation emerge from well-designed public spaces. By connecting with larger global movements focused on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives and the Social Determinants of Health, Build a Better Block works to enhance community well-being and promote sustainable urban development.

Through their innovative approach, Build a Better Block continues to transform public spaces, creating environments where people can connect, thrive, and engage with their surroundings.

Founded in December 2021, Comets for Better Tranist has quickly become one of the largest activist student organizations at the University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas). The organization advocates for alternative transportation solutions, aiming to make the campus and surrounding community more accessible without the need for cars. Their focus includes promoting public transportation options such as buses and trains, enhancing the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, and influencing urban planning to improve the quality of life for all residents.

Members of the organization actively participate in local city council meetings, engaging with officials, community members, and the university to advocate for their goals. Among their notable accomplishments are successfully pushing for higher bus frequencies near campus and advocating for the rezoning of an undeveloped lot near campus to support a future transit-oriented housing development.

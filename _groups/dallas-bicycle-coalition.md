Dallas Bicycle Coalition unites and elevates the voices of cycling advocates in the City of Dallas. By collaborating with bike-friendly groups, social bike ride organizers, bike-friendly businesses, and other advocates, we promote bike-friendly ideas and policies while working to grow the cycling community through events and education.

We advocate for safer streets, improved bike and pedestrian infrastructure, and the growth of bike-friendly and social bike ride groups in Dallas. Additionally, we host informative and engaging events for cyclists throughout the city.

Dallas Bicycle Coalition envisions a future where cycling is a popular, convenient, and safe mode of transportation and recreation. In this vision, a connected network of bicycle infrastructure and thoughtfully designed streets enhances the local economy and supports vibrant, thriving communities across Dallas.

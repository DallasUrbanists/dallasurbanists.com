The Dallas Housing Coalition (DHC) is a grassroots, volunteer-powered organization uniting over 245 non- and for-profit groups and individuals to advocate for attainable housing in Dallas. Established in 2022 and officially launched in June 2023, DHC earned its 501(c)(3) status in September 2023. Its coalition includes housing developers, policy experts, and advocates dedicated to serving diverse populations, including seniors, veterans, families, persons with disabilities, and individuals experiencing homelessness.

Dallas faces a critical housing shortage, with over half of renters burdened by housing costs and a homeownership rate below the state average. DHC addresses this crisis through advocacy, public education, and policy initiatives, guided by input from its members and Steering Committee. Its core values—equity, attainability, accessibility, sustainability, and community engagement—drive efforts to improve housing access and affordability.

DHC works to remove barriers that low- and moderate-income populations face, recognizing housing as essential for promoting health, education, and economic stability. The organization’s vision is a Dallas where every individual and family has access to safe, quality housing that supports their well-being.

Through collaboration and collective expertise, the Dallas Housing Coalition is transforming lives and making strides to ensure a brighter, more equitable future for all.

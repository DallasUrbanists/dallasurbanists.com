The Dallas Area Transit Alliance (DATA) is dedicated to advocating for improved public transit in the Greater Dallas area. Formed in response to city council resolutions targeting reductions in DART funding, DATA represents all 13 DART member cities: Dallas, Addison, Carrollton, Cockrell Hill, Farmers Branch, Garland, Glenn Heights, Highland Park, Irving, Plano, Richardson, Rowlett, and University Park.

The idea for DATA began on June 15, 2024, during a small meeting at Cole Park in Uptown Dallas, where 15 participants discussed creating an advocacy group. A follow-up meeting at the Metropolitan Building in Downtown Dallas, attracted over 50 attendees, resulting in the election of interim co-chairs Tyler Wright and Connor Hulla and the establishment of organizational priorities. Five days later, DATA’s official name was chosen by 137 members in a vote.

As part of its early efforts, DATA collaborated with Dallas transportation advocate Hexel Colorado, who launched a Change.org petition urging the DART Board of Directors to oppose funding cuts. Within two weeks of its July 16 launch, the petition gathered over 1,160 signatures, calling on the board to protect the vital sales tax contributions from all 13 member cities.

DATA’s goals are threefold: to safeguard the future of public transit in Greater Dallas, compel elected officials to prioritize transit initiatives, and offer practical, actionable solutions for improving transit systems. By championing these priorities, DATA seeks to ensure a more accessible, sustainable, and effective transit network for the region.

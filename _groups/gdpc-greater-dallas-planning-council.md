Comprised of professionals from a variety of sectors, including architecture, planning, real estate, construction, and municipal entities, the GDPC advocates for sustainable growth in the Dallas region. Their mission is to advocate, educate, and plan for a prosperous and equitable Greater Dallas.

The GDPC addresses key issues such as urban design, economic development, transportation, water, energy, and education. Through issue task forces and collaboration, the organization evaluates policies and design concepts, providing policy recommendations to local leaders and the media. Monthly breakfast meetings offer a platform for discussion on regional issues, featuring presentations from local politicians and leaders.

With a vision of uniting diverse voices to shape the future of the Dallas region, GDPC’s core values include engagement, equity, collaboration, and sustainable planning. They have been integral to the development of major regional projects, including the Dallas Plan, the outer loop freeway system feasibility study, and the Trinity River Corridor Project.

title: Why doesn’t DART share its real-time data with other apps?
subtitle: According to Transit, an app that partners with hundreds of transit agencies across the world to display routes, DART is the largest transit agency in the U.S. that doesn’t share real-time data. This means that when you open apps like Google Maps to see when your bus is coming, you’ll see what’s scheduled at each stop, but no information on delays.

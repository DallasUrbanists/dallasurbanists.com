Lisa Jordan was crossing Akard Street when [a speeding car hit and killed her](https://twitter.com/hexel_co/status/1688671113906122752?t=QVhBRuqapVvhVct3tFHQ9A&s=19) in Downtown Dallas, Texas, on August 6th, 2023. Walking "correctly" — i.e., walking when and where Lisa was "supposed to" walk — did not prevent a collision with a car turning left onto Akard from Commerce Street. The vehicle continued to crash into the Chophouse Burger on the corner of Akard & Main Street.

Conflicts with cars are a daily threat to pedestrians' safety in Dallas.

> This petition calls upon the City of Dallas to convert the portion of Akard Street between Elm and Commerce into a pedestrian mall by placing traffic barriers at the south crosswalk of the Akard & Elm intersection and the north crosswalk of the Akard & Commerce intersection.

Using the definition on pedbikesafe.org, a ["pedestrian mall"](http://www.pedbikesafe.org/pedsafe/countermeasures_detail.cfm?CM_NUM=64) is a street segment that prohibits motor vehicle traffic, aside from emergency access and time-limited essential activities such as trash pick-up and service deliveries. In the context of this petition, the phrase *"pedestrianize Akard"* refers to conversion as described above. *"The Akard segment"* refers to the portion of Akard Street between Elm St and Commerce St.

## Six Reasons to Pedestrianize Akard

1. Prevent further injury and death.
2. Car access is unnecessary in the Akard segment.
3. Enhance walkability near public transit.
4. Accommodate bicycles and scooters.
5. Provide open space for retail and hotels on Akard.
6. Make downtown more fun and interesting! 

## Reason #1: Prevent further injury and death

Headlines say Dallas has "the worst drivers" among large cities in the United States. This conclusion is based on a Forbes study that ranked Dallas as:

- 7th-highest total fatal car crashes
- 3rd-highest number of crashes involving a drunk driver
- 4th-highest number of fatal crashes involving speeding

It's useless to wish people would "just drive better" in Dallas. The best way to prevent crashes is by reducing the opportunities for conflict between pedestrians and cars in the first place. The easiest way to do that is by blocking car access to spaces where car access is unnecessary.

## Reason #2: Car access is unnecessary in the Akard segment

There are no parking garages with entrances or exits in the Akard segment. Vehicle access to the segment can be limited to service, delivery, and emergency vehicles. Any car trips that would have taken Akard Street would not need to detour more than a block to reach their destinations on Elm, Main, and Commerce Streets. 

## Reason #3: Enhance walkability near public transit

Akard Street is at the center of a light rail station serving all train lines and two bus stops serving almost every bus route downtown. This means the Akard segment possibly has the highest amount of daily foot traffic in the city.

With so many people from all walks of life — all ages, abilities, classes, races, beliefs, physical and mental conditions — it only makes sense that walking on the Akard segment should be as useful, safe, comfortable,  and interesting as possible. (Notice how these are the four qualities of author Jeff Speck's 4 Ways to Make a City More Walkable)

## Reason #4: Accommodate bicycles and scooters

There are only a few protected bicycle lanes and tracks downtown. Thus, people on bicycles and scooters often ride on the sidewalk alongside pedestrians instead of on the roadbed. By removing the danger of car traffic on the Akard segment, more people on bicycles and scooters will choose to ride on the roadbed instead of the sidewalk, resulting in even fewer crashes and injuries among pedestrians. 

Pedestrianizing Akard also provides an opportunity for proper bicycle and scooter parking, keeping the sidewalks and curbs clear for other uses. 

## Reason #5: Provide open space for retail and hotels on Akard

Permanent establishments along the Akard segment, such as the Magnolia and the Adolphus Hotel, currently have little to no public outdoor space. By pedestrianizing Akard, permanent establishments would effectively have a "public patio" that they can use to enhance the street life for their customers and the general public.

As a new, flexible public amenity, the pedestrian mall may attract new tenants to the many available storefronts on Akard today.

## Reason #6: Make downtown more fun and interesting!

For the small price of a one-minute detour for a handful of motorists, we make the center of our city safer, fun, and vibrant for everybody —  pedestrians and motorists alike!

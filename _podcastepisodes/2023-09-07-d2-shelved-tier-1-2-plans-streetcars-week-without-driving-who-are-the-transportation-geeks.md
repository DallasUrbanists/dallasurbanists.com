# D2 subway alignment postponed indefinitely

⁠["Downtown Dallas Subway ‘D2’ Is No Longer Part of DART’s Long-Term Plans"](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/08/downtown-dallas-subway-d2-is-no-longer-part-of-darts-long-term-plans/)⁠ by Matt Goodman for D Magazine. This was the first article to break the news on mainstream media.

Editor of D Magazine, Tim Rogers, published ["⁠Matt Goodman Gets Done Dirty on DART Story":](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/08/matt-goodman-gets-done-dirty-on-dart-story/)

> "Yesterday our Matt Goodman broke a pretty big story about DART. The agency has decided not to build a $1.7 billion subway through downtown Dallas... You know how Matt learned about this news? **He got a tip from a transportation geek who had seen something in a Reddit forum about DART’s financial plan and noticed that the subway was no longer in that plan.**"
>
> "Four hours later, Ken Kalthoff over at NBC 5 published a story with \[headline that's one word short of being completely identical to Goodman's headline]... In his story, Kalthoff wrote: 'The Dallas Area Rapid Transit agency announced Tuesday that the project has been removed from the 20-year financial plan.' DART made no such announcement. Matt did. He broke the news."

[Connor posted a follow-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/comments/15tzmu2/matt_goodman_if_youre_reading_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on Reddit⁠, wherein he thanks Matt for reporting on what he saw on the [r/DART subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dart/). and encouraged him to cover DART's Tier 1 and Tier 2 plans for the bus network, a topic which remains unreported by mainstream outlets thus far.

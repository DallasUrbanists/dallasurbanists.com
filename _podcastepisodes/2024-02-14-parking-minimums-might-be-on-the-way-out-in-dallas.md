Local officials in Dallas are considering eliminating minimum parking requirements in the city. The zoning ordinance advisory committee [just voted to advance the measure to the city planning commission](https://dallasexpress.com/city/dallas-zoning-committee-advances-parking-reform/), and if approved there, it would then go on to the city council.

Critics believe that this is a one-size-fits-all approach to parking reform and that it’s not an ideal solution to Dallas’s parking dilemma, whereas proponents say the change will cut down on unused parking spaces and accelerate the city’s economic development.

So, is this measure a good or a bad move for Dallas?

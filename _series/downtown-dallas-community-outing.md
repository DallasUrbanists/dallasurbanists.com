Walk the streets of Downtown Dallas with us after dark! It's good exercise and a great way to get to know your neighborhood. We use the Dallas 311, See Say, and Oncor apps to submit service requests on the spot.

We meet for dinner/drinks at 7:15, then choose a destination and walk for one hour. The location is posted in the Facebook group and changes weekly.

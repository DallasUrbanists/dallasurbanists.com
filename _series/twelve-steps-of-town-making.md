# Whatâ€™s happening?

The 12 Steps of Town Making was created to help people strengthen their community by building a viable local ecosystem. The people who live in your neighborhood know best how to make their place sustainable, fun, and alive! Instead of depending on outside businesses that take profit away to a distant city, local people can and should grow wealth inside their community.

People learn from each other at these meetings and share their experiences in building or rebuilding their towns in efficient and sustainable ways.

# When & where?

Every 2nd & 4th Tuesday at Wax Space Coworking  (1300 S Polk St. STE 295 Dallas, TX 75224) at Tyler Station. It is recommended to take public transit.

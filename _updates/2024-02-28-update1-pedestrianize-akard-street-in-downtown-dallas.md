Want to see what traffic is like on Akard Street today and/or meet fellow urbanists to talk about walkability, housing, and transportation?

Then come and meet us!!

[From @DallasUrbanists on Instagram:](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3ptLOmMVTU/)

We're having a joint @neighborsdtx + @dallasurbanists social because we're excited about our new growth (over 7K new followers in just the last 3 weeks!) & want our community to grow IRL as well as online.

The DMs from many of you these last couple of months are inspiring & motivating!! I feel incredibly excited about what's in store for #Dallas in the coming months.

To give y'all an idea why our community size matters... a "large public turnout" at a City Hall meeting usually means ~20 people. The vast majority of public meetings have 0 to 4 people show up. Yet these meetings decide the fate of the entire city! If just 1% of our followership showed up at City Council, that's 125 people!! At 2%, there wouldn't be enough seats in Council Chambers!!! Imagine how much we could transform our city if a fraction of us show up.

So, full transparency, next Friday's social is me testing the waters: out of 12,575 followers, what percentage might show up in person? Of those who do come, what are your top interests? What energizes y'all the most? What topics need the most public awareness & educational material?

Mark your calendars. Bring a friend to make a friend from. See you soon!

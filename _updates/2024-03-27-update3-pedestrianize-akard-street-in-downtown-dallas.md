Our petition has over 1,110 signatures and three different news stories, including an interview on the front-page of [Dallas Morning News](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/transportation/2024/03/15/is-dallas-unsafe-for-walking-fatality-prompts-call-for-pedestrian-zone-at-akard-street/), What's our next move?

Please join our campaign kickoff virtual meeting this Thursday, March 28, 6:00pm! This campaign is about more than just fixing one street; our mission is to establish a blueprint for anyone to launch their own campaign in their neighborhood. Tomorrow's meeting is for anybody who wants to either help make the Akard Street pedestrian mall a reality and/or wants to learn the process for fixing a dangerous road and stepping up where our city won’t.

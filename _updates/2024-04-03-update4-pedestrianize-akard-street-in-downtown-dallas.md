With over [1,110 signatures](https://www.change.org/p/pedestrianize-akard-street-in-downtown-dallas-elm-main-commerce) and [an interview](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/transportation/2024/03/15/is-dallas-unsafe-for-walking-fatality-prompts-call-for-pedestrian-zone-at-akard-street/) on the front-page of Dallas Morning News, we held our campaign kickoff  meeting last Thursday, March 28th. This campaign is about more than just fixing one street; our mission is to establish a blueprint for anyone to launch their own campaign in their neighborhood. This campaign is for anybody who wants to either help make the Akard Street pedestrian mall a reality and/or wants to learn the process for fixing a dangerous road and stepping up where our city wonâ€™t.

I've modeled this campaign after [Strong Town's Crash Analysis Studio](https://academy.strongtowns.org/p/starting-your-own-crash-analysis-studio), a free online course teaching you how to "conduct your own studio and change the conversation about safe streets in your place." The course is easy for people without a technical background and takes around 2 hours to complete. You don't need to take the course to participate in this campaign, but I highly recommend it if you're considering launching a campaign!

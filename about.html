        <h1>About Dallas Urbanists</h1>

        <h2>What is Dallas Urbanists STLC?</h2>
        
        <p>Dallas Urbanists STLC is a group based in Dallas, Texas and composed of people who care about making our city a better place to live, work, and play for everybody. Our group aligns with the New Urbanism movement, and we are an instance of what Strong Towns calls a "Local Conversation" (LC), whose purpose is to connect nearby, like-minded advocates to put Strong Towns ideas into action where we live.</p>

        <h2>What is Strong Towns?</h2>
        
        <p>Strong Towns is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit media advocacy organization. They produce content that analyzes the failures of the post-war North American development pattern while giving citizens the knowledge and tools to start making our places better today.</p>

        <h1>What do Dallas Urbanists want?</h1>
        
        <p>While there are countless ways to make our city better, Dallas Urbanists have 3 key areas of concern.</p>
        
        <h2>More Walkability</h2>
        <p>We hold this as the highest lead measure of success for a city because it cannot be achived without good urbanism in every other measure. Walkability begins with having complete sidewalks, but it doesn't end there. A walkable city has safe streets, reliable public transit, comprehensive bicycle networks, clean air, smart urban design, and human-scale density. Urbanists want walkability because it's the foundation for healthy, happy, and sustainable communities.</p>
        
        <h2>Less Car-Dependence</h2>
        <p>We have no problem with people owning and operating private automobiles, and we recognize their inherent necessity for certain professions and lifestyle choices. However, car-dependence is the opposite of independence. Our city isn't equitable if the price of participation is $900/month in car expenses. Our city isn't diverse when we leave behind 33% of population who can't drive. To achieve independence from cars, we need a variety of safe and reliable transportation options.</p>
        
        <h2>Greater Affordability</h2>

        <h2>Who are Dallas Urbanists?</h2>
        
        <h3>In casual conversation</h3>
        <p>Just as there's no universal standard for what it means to be a "good person," we don't gatekeep on who may call themselves a "Dallas urbanist." We don't have an urbanist creed; some people consider themselves "more urbanist" than others. In any case — whether you live in a high-density apartment or a sprawling subdivision — anyone whose beliefs generally align with the New Urbanism movement and agrees with Strong Towns principles can be considered an urbanist.</p>

        <h1>History of Dallas Urbanists</h1>
        
        <p>It's difficult to pick any one person as the first Dallas urbanist. Was it Patrick Kennedy when he started his blog <a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/2015/march/patrick-kennedy-urban-planner-dallas/">Car Free in Big D</a> in 2009? Or was it George Kessler when he wrote the Kessler Plan for the City of Dallas in 1909? Or was it John Neely Bryan when he founded Dallas with the original intent of being a tradepost between settlers and the native Caddo people in 1841?</p>

      <p><em>This Dallas Life</em> is a blog about urbanism in Dallas. The blog focuses on walkability, housing,
        public transit, mobility, and sustainable city planning in the City of Dallas and the Greater Dallas
        area. Our purpose is to promote thoughtful and informed discussions about urban issues in the region.
      </p>
      <p>The blog was created by Hexel Colorado in 2022. In addition to written articles, the blog also includes
        short-form videos on TikTok and the <em>By Way of Dallas</em> podcast.</p>

        Hexel
        is a Dallas-native and lifelong DFW resident. He started
        <em>This Dallas Life</em>
        in December 2022 and is its primary contributor. Though involved in various form of community activism since he
        was a teenager, his interest
        in
        urbanism began in December 2021, when he sold his car to live car-free in <nobr>Old East Dallas.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>Hexel was appointed to DART’s Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) in May 2022. The role of the members
        of this
        public advisory group is to serve "as a two-way communication link between the DART Board, the general public
        and
        various interest groups."

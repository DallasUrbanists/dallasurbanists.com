          <b>Hexel Colorado</b>
          is a Dallas-native and lifelong DFW resident who started producing content officially under the banner of
          <em>This Dallas Life</em>
          in December 2022. Though involved in various form of community activism since he was a teenager, his interest in
          urbanism began in December 2021, when he sold his car to live car-free in Old East Dallas. Hexel is the head
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    writer for the blog and hosts the
          <em>By Way of Dallas</em>
          podcast. Hexel was appointed to DART’s Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) in May 2022. The role of the members of this
          public advisory group is to serve "as a two-way communication link between the DART Board, the general public and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    various interest groups."

    <p>While our content occasionally explores other cities and suburbs in the Dallas - Fort Worth Metroplex,

      primarily focuses on the City of Dallas and the other twelve DART member cities: Richardson, Garland, Plano,

        Why
        <em>This?</em>
      </span>
    </h1>

    <p>Throughout 2022, Hexel had been writing about Dallas urbanism on his personal blog, Instagram, and Twitter.
      Having accumulated a considerable amount of writing and original content about Dallas, it didn’t help that his
                                                                                                                              last name was “Colorado.” Thus, he acquired the domain name ThisDallasLife.com and transitioned to underwriting
                                                                                                                              under the moniker
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>.

    <p>This publication,
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>, was created in pursuit of a dream: of a more walkable, sustainable, and affordable
      Dallas; of our city breaking free from car-dependency; of the restoration of places destroyed by urban highways;

    <h2>Does the podcast have anything to do with the clothing brand?</h2>

    <p>No. It’s just a coincidence that the name of our podcast about transportation and mobility,
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>, has the same name of a locally renown clothing brand.
    </p>

    <h2>Why did we name our podcast that?</h2>

    <p>The phrase “by way of” is used to mean “By the route of; through; via.” One of the most common uses of this
      phrase is to briefly describe flight plans. For example, if someone asked me about my flight to Dallas and my
                                                                                                                              itinerary includes a layover in Chicago, I may tell someone “I’m flying to Dallas by way of Chicago.” Considering
                                                                                                                              DFW is the second busiest airport in the world, it’s likely millions of people have uttered the phrase “<em>by way
        of Dallas</em>” to describe their brief stop on route to their final destination. This is how our podcast name
      directly relates to the topic of transportation.</p>

    <p>In a philosophical sense, the podcast’s purpose is to present how the way people move in Dallas affects the way
      they live. Can you now see the connection between
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>
      and
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>?
      In a fun sense, there’s potential for a double entendre. If someone listens to the podcast and learns something
                                                                                                                              from hearing a story about someone in Dallas, they could say they “learned it
      <em>by way of Dallas</em>.” This turn of phrase would equally mean they learned something from the podcast called
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>, as well as they learned something by way of the city itself.

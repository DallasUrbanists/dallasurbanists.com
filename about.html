            <h1>What is Dallas Urbanists STLC?</h1>
            <p>We are an advocacy group in Dallas, Texas composed of people who care about making our city a better
                place to live, work, and play for everybody. Our group aligns with the New Urbanism movement, and we are
                an instance of what Strong Towns calls a "Local Conversation", whose purpose is to connect nearby,
                like-minded advocates to put Strong Towns ideas into action where we live.</p>

            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Foster informed and empathetic conversations about walkability, transportation, and housing in Dallas
                neighborhoods. Through stories and conversations, inspire locals to take action toward meaningful
                improvement for the city.</p>
            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>Dallas Urbanists began as a blog in December 2021 by Hexel Colorado, documenting his advocacy with groups like Dallas Neighbors for Housing and Dallas Bicycle Coalition. Hexel’s Instagram videos offered tips on using DART, living car-free, and covered key urban planning issues.</p>
            <p>Since then, Dallas Urbanists has become a dynamic community presence, featured by KERA Radio, Dallas Morning News, WFAA TV, and other media outlets. We have gained over 15,600 Instagram followers, collected thousands of signatures for transit and pedestrian safety, and partnered with local groups to support affordable housing and bike infrastructure.</p>
            <p>In October 2024, Dallas Urbanists became a Strong Towns Local Conversation (STLC).</p>

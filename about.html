      <strong>Hexel Colorado</strong>
      is a Dallas-native and lifelong DFW resident who started producing content officially under the banner of
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>
      in December 2022. Though involved in various form of community activism since he was a teenager, his interest in urbanism began in December 2021, when he sold his car to live car-free in Old East Dallas. Hexel is the head writer for the blog and hosts the
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>
      podcast.</p>

    <p>Hexel was appointed to DART’s Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) in May 2022. The role of the members of this public advisory group is to serve "as a two-way communication link between the DART Board, the general public and various interest groups."</p>

      Where is
        <em>This?</em>
    </span>
    </h1>

    <p>While our content occasionally explores other cities and suburbs in the Dallas - Fort Worth Metroplex,
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>
      primarily focuses on the City of Dallas and the other twelve DART member cities: Richardson, Garland, Plano, Addison, Carrollton, Cockrell Hill, Farmers Branch, Glenn Heights, Highland Park, Irving, Plano, Rowlett, and University Park.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center display-5 lined-heading mb-5 mt-5"><span>
      Why
        <em>This?</em>
    </span>
    </h1>

    <p>Throughout 2022, Hexel had been writing about Dallas urbanism on his personal blog, Instagram, and Twitter. Having accumulated a considerable amount of writing and original content about Dallas, it didn’t help that his last name was “Colorado.” Thus, he acquired the domain name ThisDallasLife.com and transitioned to underwriting under the moniker
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>.</p>

    <p>This publication,
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>, was created in pursuit of a dream: of a more walkable, sustainable, and affordable Dallas; of our city breaking free from car-dependency; of the restoration of places destroyed by urban highways; of DFW cured of sprawl and following the path blazed anew
      <em>by way of Dallas</em>.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center display-5 lined-heading mb-5 mt-5"><span>Disclaimers</span></h1>

    <h2>Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)</h2>

    <p>Though Hexel Colorado is independently involved with both,
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>
      and DART’s Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) are
      <em>
        <u>not</u>
      </em>
      affiliated. The opinions, views, and beliefs expressed by Hexel Colorado do not necessarily reflect the views of DART or the Citizens Advisory Committee.</p>

    <h2>Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART)</h2>

    <p>
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>
      is neither sanctioned nor sponsored by DART. Nobody receives compensation from DART for the production of content published on
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>. The opinions, views, and beliefs expressed on
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>
      do not reflect the views of Dallas Area Rapid Transit.</p>

    <h2>Does the podcast have anything to do with the clothing brand?</h2>

    <p>No. It’s just a coincidence that the name of our podcast about transportation and mobility,
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>, has the same name of a locally renown clothing brand.</p>

    <h2>Why did we name our podcast that?</h2>

    <p>The phrase “by way of” is used to mean “By the route of; through; via.” One of the most common uses of this phrase is to briefly describe flight plans. For example, if someone asked me about my flight to Dallas and my itinerary includes a layover in Chicago, I may tell someone “I’m flying to Dallas by way of Chicago.” Considering DFW is the second busiest airport in the world, it’s likely millions of people have uttered the phrase “<em>by way of Dallas</em>” to describe their brief stop on route to their final destination. This is how our podcast name directly relates to the topic of transportation.</p>

    <p>In a philosophical sense, the podcast’s purpose is to present how the way people move in Dallas affects the way they live. Can you now see the connection between
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>
      and
      <em>This Dallas Life</em>?
      In a fun sense, there’s potential for a double entendre. If someone listens to the podcast and learns something from hearing a story about someone in Dallas, they could say they “learned it
      <em>by way of Dallas</em>.” This turn of phrase would equally mean they learned something from the podcast called
      <em>By Way of Dallas</em>, as well as they learned something by way of the city itself.</p>

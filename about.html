        Hexel
        is a Dallas-native and lifelong DFW resident. He started
        <em>Dallas Urbanists</em>
        in December 2022 and is its primary contributor. Though involved in various form of community activism since he
        was a teenager, his interest
        in
        urbanism began in December 2021, when he sold his car to live car-free in <nobr>Old East Dallas.</nobr>
      </p>
      <p>Hexel was appointed to DARTâ€™s Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) in May 2022. The role of the members
        of this
        public advisory group is to serve "as a two-way communication link between the DART Board, the general public
        and
        various interest groups."

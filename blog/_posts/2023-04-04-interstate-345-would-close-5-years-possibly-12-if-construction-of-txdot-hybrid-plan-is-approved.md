# What’s the situation?

Dallas must decide the fate of Interstate 345, [a 50-year-old elevated freeway in Downtown Dallas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5pyjaGW7xQ), as it approaches end-of-life. In June, last month, [TxDOT released a feasibility study](https://www.keepitmovingdallas.com/I345) on possibilities for the deteriorating freeway.

The study reported on five alternatives, but the “Hybrid” alternative was selected as TxDOT’s official recommendation before last month’s public hearing. This plan would rebuild the highway inside a trench 60-feet below grade. It would retain the same number of main lanes and connections to other highways. The right-of-way would not change— the highway would take up no less and no more land than it does now.

# Before recent study, the idea of *permanent* removal had serious support.

Since 2013, advocacy groups [Coalition for a New Dallas](https://www.coalitionforanewdallas.org/i-345) and [Congress for New Urbanism](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/06/i-345-back-on-cnus-freeways-without-futures-list/) have called for removing the 1.4-mile highway and opening 245 acres of land for development. A separate [TxDOT study in 2016 reported](https://www.dmagazine.com/urbanism-transportation/2016/06/new-txdot-report-says-we-should-tear-down-i-345/) that a removal plan would bring 12,000 people and 40,000 jobs to the city, earn Dallas $80 million in additional revenue, and improve transit, bike and pedestrian access. For these reasons, [12 city councilmembers said last year they supported](https://www.coalitionforanewdallas.org/featured-posts/coalition-for-a-new-dallas-5) “removing I-345 and replacing it with a mixed-use, mixed-income neighborhood that restores the community grid and reconnects East and South Dallas.”

# Frightening traffic numbers in feasibility study changed city leaders’ minds about removing I-345.

Despite the [wealth of long-standing evidence that highways cutting through the center of a city](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html) are a principal cause of urban decay, hesitance persisted among city leaders. Fear of increased traffic congestion has always been the bane of highway removal ambitions.

TxDOT tapped into those fears with their traffic analysis of a new “Removal alternative” designed for the feasibility study. They predicted their Removal plan would increase travel time by 40% to 60% for various trips across the city. In contrast, they predicted essentially no impact on traffic from their Hybrid alternative. Their assessment was enough to [annul support of removal among members of City Council](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2022/06/dallas-city-council-members-walk-back-promise-to-remove-i-345/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2012%20current%20council%20members%20said%20they%20supported%20%E2%80%9Cremoving%20I%2D345%20and%20replacing%20it%20with%20a%20mixed%2Duse%2C%20mixed%2Dincome%20neighborhood%20that%20restores%20the%20community%20grid%20and%20reconnects%20East%20and%20South%20Dallas.%E2%80%9D) and rally support toward their Hybrid plan.

Are you interested in local legislation and how it can affect your community? Then you might want to tune in to the latest board meeting of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). It might not be the most entertaining thing to do on a Tuesday night, but it's an excellent opportunity to learn about an issue that might impact you.

During the meeting, the board discussed a proposed legislation that would require DART to provide services to its member cities at a proportional cost to what each city spends. For example, if a city like Garland contributes $50 million in sales tax to DART, the agency would be required to spend $50 million on services in Garland.

The proposed legislation is of particular concern to Plano, one of the main cities affected by the potential changes. The city has been in talks with DART about this for two years, indicating how significant this issue is.

As a concerned citizen, you might want to form an opinion about the proposed legislation. Fortunately, the board meeting was recorded, and you can watch it at your convenience by clicking on Item 15 on this link: <https://dart.swagit.com/play/04042023-772>. The entire recording is an hour long, but if you find that length intimidating, you can start with the first 30-40 minutes to form an initial opinion.

This blog post isn't about giving an opinion but about encouraging you to share your thoughts on the issue. So, don't hesitate to take the time to watch the meeting and voice your opinion on this critical matter. After all, it's your community, and your voice matters.

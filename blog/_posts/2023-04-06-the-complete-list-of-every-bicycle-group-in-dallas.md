\[﻿UPDATE: APRIL 6TH] While the spreadsheet has the basic details of every cycling group in Dallas, I'm still working on collecting additional details. While most groups meet every week, some follow a special schedule

Some of these are "public" groups — anyone can just show up at the regular meeting location and ride along. However, a few are "private" clubs — people are welcome to join, but you first need to go through a simple screening process (such as answering a Facebook questionnaire) before you may participate. Some cycling clubs have a screening policy because they meet at a member's private home.

Some clubs screen because they were specifically formed to create a safe space for their community. For example, Femme Pedale is an all-women bicycle club formed specifically to provide a safe and empowering community for female-identifying riders in an otherwise male-dominated sport.

It's taken months for this list to get to this point because every time I go out and talk to people, I learn details I didn't know before or the list grows with more clubs! If you have any tips or information about cycling groups in Dallas, please email me at hexel@thisdallalife.com. Also, you may want to bookmark this page to see updates in the future.

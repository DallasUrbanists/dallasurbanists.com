Dear DART, Ia small but powerful suggestion that I believe would greatly enhance the user experience of your transportation app. My suggestion is to implement a "Save trip" button, which would provide several valuable features for your users. Allow me to elaborate:

1. Instantly see directions for saved recurring trips: Many of us have regular destinations such as work, school, or doctor's appointments. By saving these trips, users could access directions with just a tap, saving them time and effort.
2. Real-time notification of unexpected bus and train delays: Delays happen, and they can significantly impact a person's schedule. With the proposed feature, users would receive instant notifications about delays on their subscribed routes, enabling them to plan accordingly.
3. Proactive alternate route recommendations: Delays often present opportunities for alternative routes that could save time. By analyzing real-time data, your app could suggest alternative routes to users, helping them make informed decisions and potentially avoid further delays.
4. Save trips offline for 100% availability: In areas with spotty cell service, accessing information can be a challenge. By allowing users to save their trips offline, the app would provide uninterrupted access to directions, regardless of connectivity issues.

Now, I anticipate some possible responses based on my experience with suggestions to DART staff, and I would like to address them:

"But the app already lets you pick from search history": While the search history feature is useful, it becomes less efficient when users have to search for their recurring trips repeatedly. Having home page access to saved trips would alleviate this issue and provide a more streamlined experience.

"But how much time does that really save? Just a few taps to search again.": Firstly, typing out long names or full street addresses can be time-consuming, especially for frequent destinations. Secondly, search results can be slow to load in areas with unreliable cell service. The "Save trip" feature would instantly load the information from the cache on the user's device, saving valuable time.

"But wouldn't riders already memorize their recurring trips?": While some riders may indeed have their recurring trips memorized, unexpected delays can occur. The app could instantly notify subscribed riders about these delays, allowing them to plan accordingly. Additionally, delays often present opportunities for alternate routes that can save time, and the app could provide instant recommendations.

"But we already have a notification screen for all cancellations and delays": The current notification screen may cover planned and major alerts, but it may not address delays of 5-15 minutes on specific lines. Users like myself would appreciate receiving only the alerts that directly impact their routes, ensuring they stay informed about relevant updates.

"Saving seconds on repetitive tasks won't increase ridership": I respectfully disagree. Small time-saving features can make a significant difference to riders. This "Save trip" feature could be the determining factor between perceiving a specific bus/train as occasionally delayed versus considering the entire system as consistently unreliable. The latter belief could discourage repeat ridership, while the former may foster trust and loyalty.

"That's nice, but what matters is our app shows what they're looking for in a reasonable time": It's important to consider situations where spotty cell service may prevent users from downloading information on the move. Additionally, when trying to catch the next available bus or train, instant results could be the difference between waiting 5 minutes or 20 minutes for the next ride.

"We don't want riders dependent on alerts; they should take responsibility to always check the app for bus/train status": Implementing the suggested feature would likely increase the likelihood of people actively checking the app for bus/train status. Furthermore, it is crucial to compete with car-oriented digital infrastructure that already offers the features I described.

On the topic of car-oriented digital infrastructure, it's worth noting that Google Maps provides spontaneous alerts for faster routes or ETA delays during driving instructions. Unfortunately, such features are not currently available on GoPass.

"But implementing that feature sounds hard.": Firstly, DART has successfully implemented various features that are more difficult and potentially offer less value. Secondly, implementing the "Save trip" feature is not as challenging as it may seem. By opening up your GTFS-R (real-time) data, you could enable third-party apps that already possess these features and more to provide enhanced experiences for your users.

In conclusion, I genuinely believe that implementing the "Save trip" button with the aforementioned features would greatly improve the usability and efficiency of your transportation app. It would provide users with instant access to their recurring trips, real-time notifications, proactive alternate route recommendations, and offline availability. I hope you will consider this suggestion and work towards enhancing the experience of your valued users.

[Rain causes depression](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/can-rainy-days-really-get-you-down) in many people.

[Devastating and deadly hurricanes](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/20/weather/hurricane-hilary-california-southwest-tropical-storm-sunday/index.html) rock the nation every year.

Rainy day funds are how we save for emergencies; "sunny day funds" aren't a thing.

Increases in annual rainfall increases your [insurance premiums](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance/flood-zones-affect-insurance-premiums#:~:text=Your%20flood%20insurance%20rate%20is,your%20home%27s%20risk%20of%20flooding.) while lowering your home's property value.

Flash flooding often leaves neighborhoods completely unrecognizable. Families may be picking up trash, fallen trees, and destroyed houses for weeks or months (sometimes years) after one day of intense rain; life typically returns to normal after one day of intense heat.

The fear and disdain some people feel towards rain is rational. Even when people can't articulate why ("I just don't feel good when it rains"), their misgivings are grounded in lived experience and supported by academic truths. In 2020, [approximately 34.2 million people worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293353/global-number-of-people-affected-by-floods/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20approximately%2034.2%20million,year%20peak%20registered%20in%201998.) were impacted by flooding, including being injured or losing their homes.

Imagine if someone said "I hate rain!" and you responded, "Why? That's unreasonable." *You* would be the ignorant one in that conversation, regardless of your academic knowledge and theories about rain.

Clearly, rain is *bad* and has no place in a happy and healthy community.

Right?

![Dallas Neighbors for Housing meeting at Four Corners Brewery with special guests Tony Hidid, Andreea Udrea, and Paul Carden. August 24th, 2023.](https://ucarecdn.com/c3f2c264-9882-4e11-ac50-54c2381f70dc/ "Dallas Neighbors for Housing meeting at Four Corners Brewery with special guests Tony Hidid, Andreea Udrea, and Paul Carden. August 24th, 2023.")

The topic was "The Future of Housing."

Around 60 people attended [Dallas Neighbors for Housing's](https://www.dallasneighborsforhousing.org/) monthly meeting at Four Corners Brewery, including multiple DART board members, housing and transportation advocates, small-scale residential developers, non-profit leaders, and curious Dallas locals.

Dallas Neighbors for Housing co-founder D'Andrala "DeDe" Alexander hosted with guest speakers Tony Hidid (Dallas CPC, Chair), Andreea Udrea (Dallas PUD, Asst. Director), and Paul Carden (VP of Commercial Venture, urban real estate and zoning specialist).

Dede: "What is a widespread misconception about housing that you want to address?"

With cautious preamble, Udrea answered gentrification.

She described how it's her department's duty to listen to communities as they plan for the future of neighborhoods. She is often tasked with questions like "how do we prevent gentrification?" When any change is proposed for a community - whether it be new parks, bike lanes, upgraded streetscape, or zoning for new housing - there is loud pushback over the possibility of it causing gentrification.

After decades of people being pushed out of their homes by changes that benefitted the people who took their place, it requires a tremendous degree of trust to assure them that a new change will be different this time.

Udrea concluded her answer by saying she doesn't know how, but if we are to fix the mistakes of the past and improve neighborhood health and stability for everyone, then somehow we must bridge the gap in trust.

![Trinity River filled with water up to the levees on August 22, 2022. A couple strolls by and looks out across water.](https://ucarecdn.com/c93b20fd-2bae-419a-aed5-23c31bcb67ed/ "Trinity River filled with water up to the levees on August 22, 2022. A couple strolls by and looks out across water.")

Last summer was the [second longest in DFW history,](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2022/08/10/dallas-fort-worth-officially-ends-67-day-streak-without-rainfall/) lasting 67 days without rain.

The drought ended with [the rainiest August in Dallas history](https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article264814169.html), climaxing with the most rainfall within a 24-hour period in 90 years. As soon as there was a safe break in the weather I biked down to the Trinity River to capture the river photos featured in this post.

In the span of one month, we witnessed the simultaneous beauty and devastation of rain. A state of emergency was declared, up to 15 inches of water flooded streets, destroyed homes, uprooted trees, cut internet and electricity, and [killed at least one person](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2022/08/25/dallas-fort-worth-flood-caused-as-much-as-6-billion-in-damages/) after they were swept away by floodwater.

Yet we need rain.

Not every day, but a steady supply is important for the well-being of everybody and everything. I won't patronize readers by belaboring the necessity of rain in spite of the destruction it brings. Even those who hate rain already understand and accept this:

*We need rain because we need water.*

![View from a balcony in Uptown Dallas, a prime example of both gentrification and displacement. Photo by Hexel Colorado.](https://ucarecdn.com/639dc58d-361a-4edc-9fde-7b67b4b346b2/ "View from a balcony in Uptown Dallas, a prime example of both gentrification and displacement.")

The word *gentrification* has two common definitions:

1. When people with higher-income move into a neighborhood predominantly occupied by low-income households.
2. When people with higher-income move into a neighborhood predominantly occupied by low-income households ***AND*** when low-income households are forced out of a neighborhood by economic pressure.

People who use the term under either definition generally understand two other things: higher-income people moving into a gentrifying neighborhood tend to be white, and low-income households in those neighborhoods tend to be black and brown people.

It's worth noting the racial implications of gentrification because while the pressures that push people out of a neighborhood are economic, the status of whether or not gentrification has occurred in a neighborhood is (for better or worse) typically measured by race due to the strong [correlation between race and income](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/racial-inequality-in-the-united-states#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20Black%20and%20Hispanic,as%20shown%20in%20Figure%204.). Thus, gentrification can reasonably be translated into one of two pseudo-definitions:

1. When white people move into a black and brown neighborhood.
2. When white people move into a black and brown neighborhod ***AND*** black and brown people are pushed out.

![](https://ucarecdn.com/c5c89ef8-1e9c-4861-8ec2-394eb07a7087/)

People don't fear white people moving in.

We just don't want black and brown people pushed out.

It's not the presence of white people and white culture that makes neighborhoods unrecognizable; it's the absence of black and brown people and culture that makes neighborhoods unrecognizable. New buildings with additional height, higher densities, or modern architecture are not what depress people; it's the reminder that our uncles, aunts, and cousins used to live there and now they don't.

[](https://www.texasobserver.org/dallas-hidden-history-of-terror/)Displacement of black and brown people is almost always precipitated by white people wanting what colored people have, and Dallas has a history of pushing black people out through [seemingly innocuous accommodations.](https://www.texasobserver.org/dallas-hidden-history-of-terror/) The question for urban planners and community activists isn't "how do we prevent white people from moving in?" but rather...

1. "As new people move in, how do we avoid pushing people out?"
2. "As new people move in, how do we keep black and brown culture present and visible so that our built environment reminds us of a proud legacy rather than of painful trauma?" 

As we tackle these questions, the solutions we discover will have the following traits:

1. We don't prevent people from moving in (because new people was never the issue).
2. We empower people with the ability to stay in the neighborhood if they choose (because this has always been the issue).
3. We increase the quantity of physical reminders of people's legacy (because otherwise the existing artifacts of people's legacy would be overshadowed by the increased quantity of outsider artifacts).
4. The neighborhood gains a greater diversity of colors, culture, and heritage (because diversity always was and is a virtue).

![Trinity River filled with water up to the levees on August 22, 2022. The sky briefly had a purple hue as the rain let up and evening grew darker. Photo taken by Hexel Colorado.](https://ucarecdn.com/3e016662-3930-4123-a5b8-8c1773307ccb/ "Trinity River filled with water up to the levees on August 22, 2022. The sky briefly had a purple hue as the rain let up and evening grew darker. Photo taken by Hexel Colorado.")

This purple-colored sky made me question my sanity.

Over-editing colors can be dishonest. My rule of thumb is that edits should enhance and magnify things that were really there, but never add something that was never there at all. I'll edit out trash to enhance from the water, or remove power lines for a clearer view of the sky. I might combine two photos taken minutes apart to simultaneously show two things that were really there.

But if the sky wasn't purple in real life, then it shouldn't be purple in the photo. [I had to do some research](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChqPUx8MkOl/?img_index=3) to prove to myself that the color was real.

It wasn't that I didn't believe a purple color was possible; I just never noticed one here before.

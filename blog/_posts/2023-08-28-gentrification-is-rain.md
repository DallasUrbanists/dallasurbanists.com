[Rain causes depression](https://www.webmd.com/balance/features/can-rainy-days-really-get-you-down) in many people.

[Devastating and deadly hurricanes](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/20/weather/hurricane-hilary-california-southwest-tropical-storm-sunday/index.html) rock the nation every year.

Rainy day funds are how we save for emergencies; "sunny day funds" aren't a thing.

Increases in annual rainfall increases your [insurance premiums](https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance/flood-zones-affect-insurance-premiums#:~:text=Your%20flood%20insurance%20rate%20is,your%20home%27s%20risk%20of%20flooding.) while lowering your home's property value.

Flash flooding often leaves neighborhoods completely unrecognizable. Families may be picking up trash, fallen trees, and destroyed houses for weeks or months (sometimes years) after one day of intense rain; life typically returns to normal after one day of intense heat.

The fear and disdain some people feel towards rain is rational. Even when people can't articulate why ("I just don't feel good when it rains"), their misgivings are grounded in lived experience and supported by academic truths. In 2020, [approximately 34.2 million people worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293353/global-number-of-people-affected-by-floods/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20approximately%2034.2%20million,year%20peak%20registered%20in%201998.) were impacted by flooding, including being injured or losing their homes.

Imagine if someone said "I hate rain!" and you responded, "Why? That's unreasonable." *You* would be the ignorant one in that conversation, regardless of your academic knowledge and theories about rain.

Clearly, rain is *bad* and has no place in a happy and healthy community.

Right?

August 24th, 2023.](https://ucarecdn.com/c3f2c264-9882-4e11-ac50-54c2381f70dc/ "Dallas Neighbors for Housing meeting at Four Corners Brewery with special guests Tony Hidid, Andreea Udrea, and Paul Carden. August 24th, 2023.")

Around 60 people attended [Dallas Neighbors for Housing's](https://www.dallasneighborsforhousing.org/) monthly meeting at Four Corners Brewery, including multiple DART board members, housing and transportation advocates, small-scale residential developers, non-profit leaders, and curious Dallas locals.

The topic was "The Future of Housing." Dallas Neighbors for Housing co-founder D'Andrala "DeDe" Alexander hosted with guest speakers Tony Hidid (Dallas CPC, Chair), Andreea Udrea (Dallas PUD, Asst. Director), and Paul Carden (VP of Commercial Venture, urban real estate and zoning specialist).

Dede: "What is a widespread misconception about housing that you want to address?"

With cautious preamble, Udrea answered gentrification.

She described how it's her department's duty to listen to communities as they plan for the future of neighborhoods. She is often tasked with questions like "how do we prevent gentrification?" When any change is proposed for a community - whether it be new parks, bike lanes, upgraded streetscape, or zoning for new housing - there is loud pushback over the possibility of it causing gentrification.

After decades of people being pushed out of their homes by changes that benefitted the people who took their place, it requires a tremendous degree of trust to assure them that a new change will be different this time.

Udrea concluded her answer by saying she doesn't know how, but if we are to fix the mistakes of the past and improve neighborhood health and stability for everyone, then somehow we must bridge the gap in trust.

![Trinity River filled with water up to the levees on August 22, 2022. A couple strolls by and looks out across water.](https://ucarecdn.com/c93b20fd-2bae-419a-aed5-23c31bcb67ed/ "Trinity River filled with water up to the levees on August 22, 2022. A couple strolls by and looks out across water.")

The longest dryspell in Dallas history started June 2000 and lasted 84 consecutive summer days without rain. Last summer was the [second longest in DFW history,](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2022/08/10/dallas-fort-worth-officially-ends-67-day-streak-without-rainfall/) lasting 67 days without rain.

The drought ended with [the rainiest August in Dallas history](https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/fort-worth/article264814169.html), climaxing with the most rainfall within a 24-hour period in 90 years. I didn't realize on the day that it would be a once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity, but as soon as there was a safe break in the weather I rode my bicycle down to the Trinity River to capture the river photos featured in this post.

In the span of one month, we witnessed the simultaneous beauty and devastation of rain. The governor sign a disaster declaration for 23 counties, including Dallas and Tarrant. Up to 15 inches of water flooded streets, destroyed homes, uprooted trees, cut internet and electricity, and [killed at least one person](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2022/08/25/dallas-fort-worth-flood-caused-as-much-as-6-billion-in-damages/) after they were swept away by floodwater.

Yet need rain.

Not every day, but a steady supply is important for the well-being of everybody and everything. I won't patronize readers by belaboring the necessity of rain in spite of the destruction it brings. Even those who hate rain already understand and accept this:

*We need rain because we need water.*

The word *gentrification* has two common definitions:

1. When people with higher-income move into a neighborhood predominantly occupied by low-income households.
2. When people with higher-income move into a neighborhood predominantly occupied by low-income households **and** the low-income households are forced out of the neighborhood by economic pressures.

No matter which definition is meant, people generally understand that

> "This is a prime example of why we need to modernize our parking requirements. Itâ€™s not always just about new development, but parking can also impact preservation and restoration." - [Chad West, Dallas City Councilman District 1](https://twitter.com/ChadWestDallas/status/1696160540962300209)

Yesterday, April Towery published a story about a building in Old East Dallas built in 1921 with historic and cultural significance as the site of Hartgraves Cafe, where Bonnie Parker worked before Bonnie and Clyde became nationally notorious criminals. New owners purchased the old cafe building earlier this year and plan to open a wine bar.

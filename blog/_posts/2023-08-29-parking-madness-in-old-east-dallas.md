# Old East Dallas - Wine Bar & Bottle Shop

[The full story was reported by April Towery](https://candysdirt.com/2023/08/28/redevelopment-plan-for-an-old-east-dallas-cafe-with-bonnie-and-clyde-ties-hits-a-roadblock-with-parking-requirements/) on CandysDirt.com.

Chase Beakley leased space in a long-vacant 102-year-old building on Swiss Avenue, near Baylor Medical. The historic structure was originally the Hartgraves Cafe, the upstanding workplace of one Bonnie Parker before her crime spree with Clyde Barrow — giving it an added historic and cultural significance for Dallas and a likely draw for true crime buffs.

Beakley is working to open a wine bar and bottle shop. There are 8 off-street parking spaces attached to the historic building. To open as a cafe like in Bonnie's day, the city requires 46 off-street parking spaces. Building a parking lot twice the size of the cafe itself is prohibitively expensive, so Beakley paid a consultant $50,000 to reconfigure the space and game the parking code so he can open shop with the parking available.

“Ultimately, we decided to sign our lease without being sure we could meet the parking minimum requirements,” he said. “This was a huge risk that many entrepreneurs wouldn’t have been able to take.”

Ironically, [according to real estate developer Nathan Barrett](https://twitter.com/ncoxbarrett/status/1696175066713600028), there's a thousand parking spaces surrounding the old Hartgraves Cafe in the form of parking lots, parking garages, and curb-side parking. No matter how empty the other spaces may be, the city only counts dedicated off-street parking towards the minimum.

# Lower Greenville - Cheesecake, Boba, Hair, & Yoga

Stories on [Val's Cheesecake](https://lakewood.advocatemag.com/vals-cheesecakes-parking/#gsc.tab=0) and [denied late-night hours](https://lakewood.advocatemag.com/plan-commission-denies-late-hours/#gsc.tab=0) reported by Renee Umstead for Advocate Magazine.

Val’s Cheesecakes has been serving cheesecake and wine bottles to-go since opening his tiny corner shop on Greenville Ave in 2017. He currently has 6 parking spaces, but in order to legally allow customers to eat and drink inside his store, city code requires 2 more. But there is no space for more parking in his tight street corner, so customers must eat their cheesecake on the sidewalk and drink their bottled wine at home.

He's asked the neighboring businesses if any of them would lease out a couple spaces but they all said no. Not even the Blue Goose across the street would spare space; [the goose has since closed its doors and flown away](https://www.dallasnews.com/food/restaurant-news/2023/02/28/dallas-original-blue-goose-restaurant-is-closing-on-greenville-avenue/), so nobody is allowed to park there at all now.

The total lack of neighborly support on parking isn't caused by pure greed (after all, a monthly parking lease payment would be a consistent income stream for the lessor). There's yet another unnecessary hurdle from the city: in order for two businesses to enter into a private agreement to share parking, [parking code requires all parties sign onto a new deed restriction](https://twitter.com/ncoxbarrett/status/1688766359058976769). Deed restrictions are city legislation; it's prohibitively expensive to lawyer up and get passed and even more difficult to undo in the future. That's too much trouble for any business to go through just to help out with 2 parking spaces.

> "New hours are due to outdated, ludicous, nonsensical parking requirements being enforced by the City of Dallas."

Three businesses - Feng Cha (boba tea), Balanced Being Yoga & Wellness, and Sugaring NYC (hair removal studio) - had their requests to stay open until 10:00 pm denied by the City Plan Commission. Currently, the businesses must close by 7:00 pm. In order to stay open late night, the city requires more parking than these three businesses currently have.

There are two ways they could've gotten more parking: leased space and delta points.

As described earlier for Val's Cheesecake, it's not easy to come up with a new parking lease agreement. Public parking lots are the only source of attainable leased space, but those are in limited supply and are gobbled up by bigger players on the block, like Trader Joe's. 

![Several big box stores like Sprouts, Fiesta, Sams Club, and CVS Pharmacy have exclusive rights to hundreds of empty parking spaces.](https://ucarecdn.com/038320c9-a310-4dfb-aa8d-5ea9a8fb3908/-/crop/4000x2474/0,285/-/preview/ "Several big box stores like Sprouts, Fiesta, Sams Club, and CVS Pharmacy have exclusive rights to hundreds of empty parking spaces.")

The other way to acquire more parking is through "imaginary parking spaces" called delta points. [Nathan Barrett wrote a piece in 2017](https://medium.com/@ncoxbarrett/parking-and-delta-credits-or-why-old-decrepit-buildings-in-dallas-stay-that-way-8a9d9813a752) explaining how the point system works. The simple explanation is that historic buildings are given "free passes" in the form of delta points. Let's say you live in an old building with ten delta points and the parking code requires you have fifteen; 15 minus 10 is 5 parking spaces you need to provide.

So how many delta points does Feng Cha have for being in a historic building?

Zero.

You can lose delta points for arbitrary reasons. The building was empty for a couple years.

Meanwhile, [over 1,400 parking spaces](https://twitter.com/hexel_co/status/1688763229990797312) at Sprouts, Fiesta, Sams Club, Mockingbird Station, and the abandoned corner CVS are unleasable.

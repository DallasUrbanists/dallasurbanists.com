> **Old East Dallas**

> Chase Beakley leased space in a long-vacant 102-year-old building on Swiss Avenue, near Baylor Medical. The historic structure was originally the Hartgraves Cafe, the upstanding workplace of one Bonnie Parker before her crime spree with Clyde Barrow — giving it an added historic and cultural significance for Dallas and a likely draw for true crime buffs.
>
> Beakley is working to open a wine bar and bottle shop. There are 8 off-street parking spaces attached to the historic building. To open as a cafe like in Bonnie's day, the city requires 46 off-street parking spaces. Building a parking lot twice the size of the cafe itself is prohibitively expensive, so Beakley paid a consultant $50,000 to reconfigure the space and game the parking code so he can open shop with the parking available.

> “Ultimately, we decided to sign our lease without being sure we could meet the parking minimum requirements,” he said. “This was a huge risk that many entrepreneurs wouldn’t have been able to take.”

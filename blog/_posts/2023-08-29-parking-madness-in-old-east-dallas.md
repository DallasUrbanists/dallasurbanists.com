> "This is a prime example of why we need to modernize our parking requirements. It’s not always just about new development, but parking can also impact preservation and restoration." - [Chad West, Dallas City Councilman District 1](https://twitter.com/ChadWestDallas/status/1696160540962300209)

Yesterday, April Towery published a story about a building in Old East Dallas built in 1921 with historical and cultural significance as the site of Hartgraves Cafe, where Bonnie Parker worked before Bonnie and Clyde became nationally notorious criminals. [Read Towery's article on CandysDirt.com](https://candysdirt.com/2023/08/28/redevelopment-plan-for-an-old-east-dallas-cafe-with-bonnie-and-clyde-ties-hits-a-roadblock-with-parking-requirements/) for the full story.

Chase Beakly leased space in the historic building to open a wine bar and bottle shop. [](https://candysdirt.com/2023/08/28/redevelopment-plan-for-an-old-east-dallas-cafe-with-bonnie-and-clyde-ties-hits-a-roadblock-with-parking-requirements/)

Despite being a restaurant 100 years ago, the new owners spent $50,000 on a consultant to create a plan for complying with the city's requirement for 46 off-street parking spaces. This heavy toll comes before the actual cost of constructing the parking.

“Ultimately, we decided to sign our lease without being sure we could meet the parking minimum requirements,” says Chase Beakly, one of the building's co-owners. “This was a huge risk that many entrepreneurs wouldn’t have been able to take.”

One would assume that a building that was a cafe 100 years ago should have no problem becoming serving beverages today. Unfortunately, it's not simple at all.

Time and money is required to address the complexity of Dallas’ parking requirements. Chase Beakley, the building's new owner, spent about $50,000 on an architect and zoning consultant to create a layout offering the right proportion of retail and restaurant space.

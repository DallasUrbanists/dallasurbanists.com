Not everybody does. Not everybody has to. Nonetheless, anybody can and many people do, myself included.

Nobody's orbituary reads "died for lack of car." In contrast, [hundreds are killed by cars every year in Dallas alone](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/11/dallas-has-the-second-worst-traffic-fatality-rate-in-the-country/). Cars kill, on average, four people in Dallas every week.

If it weren't for cars, there would be more people actually living in Dallas to begin with. That's no exaggeration: [car-oriented suburbs absorbed the lion share of DFW growth](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/05/dfw-grew-faster-than-any-region-in-the-u-s-last-year-but-dallas-didnt-make-up-its-losses/) while the City of Dallas was the only city to have a net loss in population during the pandemic. One principal reason for our slow growth is [a quarter of our developable land is dedicated to car storage](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/03/a-quarter-of-downtown-dallas-is-parking-lots-could-that-change/) for suburban commuters rather than housing for people without cars to live in.

> Technically, yes.

> Practically, it depends.

For starters, owning a car is incredibly expensive. Especially in Dallas, [where average insurance premiums are the second highest among Texas cities](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/texas/dallas-car-insurance#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20car,(and%20the%20national%20average).). Whenever I mention how the [cost of car ownership for most people is at least $500 per month](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/auto-loans/total-cost-owning-car), everybody I talk to in Dallas quickly points out that it's closer to $700 or $800 for them.

Car ownership alone costs between 50% and 100% of most people's rent in this city. Imagine everything you could do if you weren't paying double rent every month. You could move to a slightly more expensive but truly walkable neighborhood (which I did). Or you could put those savings towards things you actually enjoy more than being stuck in traffic, like food, concerts, shows, and recreational activities with friends.

[Auto theft in Dallas is at a record high and climbing](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/auto-theft-reports-hitting-new-highs-in-north-texas/), with 13,412 cars and trucks stolen just last year in Dallas alone. Last week, I went out to dinner with three friends and all of them had their car towed, totaled, or both within the last year; only one of the three managed to get their car back and that's who drove the other two that night.

Last January, even without owning a car I too had a car towed when, to my embarrasment, I made a mistake advising where my should park her car on her first day visiting me from Paris. She had borrowed her parents car for the visit, and we had to take a Lyft to the tow yard in South Dallas.

There are challenges I used to have everyday that I don't even think about since letting go of my car two years ago:

* Am I allowed to park here?
* Will there be parking when I get there?
* How do validate my parking?
* Is it safe to park here?
* How early should I leave to get a good parking spot?
* Am I too close to the curb?
* Am I too far from the curb?
* Will anyone judge my parallel parking if I go for it?
* Do I need to top up the meter?
* Did I leave anything important in the car?
* Should I fill up on gas in advanced?
* Is my car too messy? Should I get it cleaned?
* Will that buff out? Will anyone notice?
* Should I try to fix this mechanical issue myself to save money?
* Will anyone care if I pretend to not notice the Check Engine light?
* Which body shop should I take this too?
* Is this repair quote fair or am I being ripped off?
* Do I really need the premium oil?
* If there's a speed trap ahead, should I still go with the speed of traffic or slow to the limit?
* What am I supposed to say again if a cop pulls me over?
* Will this person judge me by my car? Should I care?
* Am I safe to drive after one drink?
* If I take an Uber home, what happens to my car?

Of course, just because owning a car is difficult doesn't mean not having a car is easy.

What are the practical factors to consider?

We're getting there...

This is where rubber meets the road.

Do cars make some people happy? Sure. [There's plenty of evidence of that across DFW.](https://www.instagram.com/carsandcoffee_dallas/?hl=en)

Do you need a car to be happy? Objectively, no. There is no mention of cars in either [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) nor in [Max-Neef's taxonomy of fundamental human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef%27s_Fundamental_human_needs). 

Are there people in Dallas happy without a car? Yes. For starters, I'm not exaggerating when I say the last two years without a car have been the happiest, healthiest, and most satisfying years of my life. I wouldn't say letting go of my car was the sole reason, but I can honestly say it's a big reason.

Secondly, if we said cars are a necessity for happiness, what does that say about everyone who can't own or operate a vehicle? Do we dare suggest that people with motor impairments have zero means of pursuing happiness in a city like Dallas?

It doesn't take a genius to realize it's not the car that makes us happy, but what the car allows us to do that makes us happy.

Therein lies the rub...

> What makes \*you\* happy?
>
> And do you need a car for that?

You don't need a car if you can find a way to get what you want out of life in Dallas without one.

If you can't, then you need a car.

Of course, it's not simply a matter of having a positive mental attitude. If it were, [the number of Dallas households with a car](https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-ceo/2018/september/rethinking-dallas-attraction-to-the-automobile/#:~:text=According%20to%20American%20Community%20Survey,metropolitan%20statistical%20areas%20(MSAs).) would be more like 50% instead of 95%.

Ultimately, whether or not you individually need a car depends on what you choose to value and, tacitly, what you choose to tradeoff. For example, by driving to work you gain time plus comfort; in exchange, you give up money [and health](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/upshot/stuck-and-stressed-the-health-costs-of-traffic.html). Public transit, bicycling, and walking are all options that come with their own benefits and tradeoffs.

The intensity of those benefits and tradeoffs is where the quality of the city enters the equation.

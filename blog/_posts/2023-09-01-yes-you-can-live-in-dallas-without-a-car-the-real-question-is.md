Not everybody does. Not everybody has to. Nonetheless, anybody can and many people do, myself included.

Nobody's orbituary reads "died for lack of car." In contrast, [hundreds are killed by cars every year in Dallas alone](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/11/dallas-has-the-second-worst-traffic-fatality-rate-in-the-country/). Cars kill, on average, four people in Dallas every week.

If it weren't for cars, there would be more people actually living in Dallas to begin with. That's no exaggeration: [car-oriented suburbs absorbed the lion share of DFW growth](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/05/dfw-grew-faster-than-any-region-in-the-u-s-last-year-but-dallas-didnt-make-up-its-losses/) while the City of Dallas was the only city to have a net loss in population during the pandemic. One principal reason for our slow growth is [a quarter of our developable land is dedicated to car storage](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/03/a-quarter-of-downtown-dallas-is-parking-lots-could-that-change/) for suburban commuters rather than housing for people without cars to live in.

> Is it easy to live in Dallas without a car?
>
> Technically, yes.

> Practically, it depends.

For starters, owning a car is incredibly expensive. Especially in Dallas, [where average insurance premiums are the second highest among Texas cities](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/texas/dallas-car-insurance#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20car,(and%20the%20national%20average).). Whenever I mention how the [cost of car ownership for most people is at least $500 per month](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/auto-loans/total-cost-owning-car), everybody I talk to in Dallas quickly points out that it's closer to $700 or $800 for them.

Car ownership alone costs between 50% and 100% of most people's rent in this city. Imagine everything you could do if you weren't paying double rent every month. You could move to a slightly more expensive but truly walkable neighborhood (which I did). Or you could put those savings towards things you actually enjoy more than being stuck in traffic, like food, concerts, shows, and recreational activities with friends.

> All these costs assume you've managed to keep your car.

> We tend to forget cars are difficult to keep and easy to lose.

[Auto theft in Dallas is at a record high and climbing](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/auto-theft-reports-hitting-new-highs-in-north-texas/), with 13,412 cars and trucks stolen just last year in Dallas alone. Last week, I went out to dinner with three friends and all of them had their car towed, totaled, or both within the last year; only one of the three managed to get their car back and that's who drove the other two that night.

There are challenges I used to have everyday that I don't even think about since letting go of my car two years ago:

* Am I allowed to park here?
* Will there be parking when I get there?
* How do validate my parking?
* Is it safe to park here?
* How early should I leave to get a good parking spot?
* Am I too close to the curb?
* Am I too far from the curb?
* Will anyone judge my parallel parking if I go for it?
* Do I need to top up the meter?
* Did I leave anything important in the car?
* Should I fill up on gas in advanced?
* Is my car too messy? Should I get it cleaned?
* Will that buff out? Will anyone notice?
* Should I try to fix this mechanical issue myself to save money?
* Will anyone care if I pretend to not notice the Check Engine light?
* Which body shop should I take this too?
* Is this repair quote fair or am I being ripped off?
* Do I really need the premium oil?
* If there's a speed trap ahead, should I still go with the speed of traffic or slow to the limit?
* What am I supposed to say again if a cop pulls me over?
* Will this person judge me by my car? Should I care?
* Am I safe to drive after one drink?
* If I take an Uber home, what happens to my car?

Of course, just because owning a car is difficult doesn't mean not having a car is easy.

What are the practical factors to consider?

We're getting there...

This is where rubber meets the road.

Do cars make some people happy? Sure. [There's plenty of evidence of that across DFW.](https://www.instagram.com/carsandcoffee_dallas/?hl=en)

Do you need a car to be happy? Objectively, no. There is no mention of cars in either [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) nor in [Max-Neef's taxonomy of fundamental human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef%27s_Fundamental_human_needs). 

Are there people in Dallas happy without a car? Yes. For starters, I'm not exaggerating when I say the last two years without a car have been the happiest, healthiest, and most satisfying years of my life. I wouldn't say letting go of my car was the sole reason, but I can honestly say it's a big reason.

Secondly, if we said cars are a necessity for happiness, what does that say about everyone who can't own or operate a vehicle? Do we dare suggest that people with motor impairments have zero means of pursuing happiness in a city like Dallas?

It doesn't take a genius to realize it's not the car that makes us happy, but what the car allows us to do that makes us happy.

Therein lies the rub...

> What makes \*you\* happy?
>
> And do you need a car for that?

You don't need a car if you can find a way to get what you want out of life in Dallas without one.

If you can't, then you need a car.

Of course, it's not simply a matter of having a positive mental attitude. Otherwise, [the rate of Dallas households with a car](https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-ceo/2018/september/rethinking-dallas-attraction-to-the-automobile/#:~:text=According%20to%20American%20Community%20Survey,metropolitan%20statistical%20areas%20(MSAs).) would be more like 50%, not 95%.

Your likelihood of needing a car is a function of three variables.

* **Lifestyle:** the choices you make
* **Infrastructure:** the options provided by the city
* **Sprawl:** the choices society made

Despite it's shortcomings, Dallas is actually a high infrastructure city.

When it comes to public transit, no other city in Texas comes close to Dallas' coverage and variety of modes. The central city is composed of pockets of highly walkable neighborhoods, including Bishop Arts, Lowest Greenville, and Uptown. Mockingbird Station is a poster child for Transit-Oriented Development in North Texas. I'm very hopeful for the Master Bike Plan that the city is currently drafting.

I'm personally moving from Old East Dallas (a good walkable area) to Downtown (peak transit and walkability in the city) in a month. It may sound rash, but the best advice but the best advice I can give for anyone moving to Dallas is to find one of these highly walkable and transit-connected neighborhoods and use your savings from not having a car to live there.

If Dallas already has high infrastructure, then why do most people still need cars? There are several factors, but two fundamental reasons:

* Most people don't live or work near the infrastructure.
* The infrastructure is spread thin across large, low-density areas.

This is sprawl.

> An average of 112 thousand people rode DART each day in 2022.
>
> That's a lot of people, but unless you're one of them, then you only have a 1.5% chance of meeting any of them in our metroplex of 7.6 million people.

This is unfortunate if you leave the geography of your life entirely up to fate:

* You'll need a car to visit 98.5% of your friends.
* Your job has a 98.5% chance of requiring a car to commute.
* Your home has a 98.5% chance of requiring a car to go anywhere.
* There's a 98.5% chance you can only drive to your favorite coffeeshop / hangout. 
* 98.5% of your life is dependent on a car.

Ninety-eight percent is practically a gaurantee. So that settles it, right? You definitely need a car in Dallas? Well, this calculus depends on a binary criteria:

***Do you leave the geography of your life entirely up to fate?***

Herein lies both the challenge and opportunity of living in Dallas.

*The bad news:* unlike cities that are less car-oriented and more walkable, you're going to need a car if you let fate choose your work, home, and social life for you.

*The good news:* Dallas has the necessary ingredients to live a car-free life for those willing and able to choose it.

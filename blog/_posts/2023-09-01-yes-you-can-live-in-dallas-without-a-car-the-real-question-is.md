Not everybody does. Not everybody has to. Nonetheless, anybody can, and many people do, myself included.

Nobody's obituary reads, "died for lack of car." In contrast, [hundreds are killed by cars every year in Dallas alone](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/11/dallas-has-the-second-worst-traffic-fatality-rate-in-the-country/). Cars kill, on average, four people in Dallas every week.

First, owning a car is incredibly expensive, especially in Dallas, [where average insurance premiums are the second highest among Texas cities](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/texas/dallas-car-insurance#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20car,(and%20the%20national%20average).). Whenever I mention how the [cost of car ownership for most people is at least $500 per month](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/auto-loans/total-cost-owning-car), everybody I talk to in Dallas quickly points out that it's closer to $800 per month for them.

Car ownership alone can cost between 50% and 100% of most people's rent in Dallas.

Imagine what you could do if you weren't paying double rent because of your car. You could move to a slightly more expensive but genuinely walkable neighborhood (which I did). Or you could put those savings towards things you enjoy more than being stuck in traffic, like food, concerts, shows, and recreational activities with friends.

[Auto theft in Dallas is at a record high and climbing](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/auto-theft-reports-hitting-new-highs-in-north-texas/), with 13,412 cars and trucks stolen in 2022 in Dallas alone. Last week, I went out to dinner with three friends, and all of them had their car towed, totaled, or both within the last year; only one of the three managed to get their car back, and that's who drove the other two that night.

There are challenges I used to have every day that I don't even think about since letting go of my car two years ago:

* Am I allowed to park here?
* Will there be parking when I get there?
* How do I validate my parking?
* Is it safe to park here?
* How early should I leave to get a good parking spot?
* Am I too close to the curb?
* Am I too far from the curb?
* Will anyone judge my parallel parking if I go for it?
* Do I need to top up the meter?
* Should I fill up on gas in advance?
* Is my car too messy? Should I get it cleaned?
* Will that buff out? Will anyone notice?
* Should I fix this mechanical issue myself to save money?
* Will anyone care if I pretend to not see the Check Engine light?
* Which body shop should I take this to?
* Is this repair quote fair, or am I being ripped off?
* Do I really need the premium oil?
* Should I still go with the traffic speed or slow to the limit if there's a speed trap ahead?
* What am I supposed to say again if a cop pulls me over?
* Will this person judge me by my car? Should I care?
* Am I safe to drive after one drink?
* If I take an Uber home, what happens to my car?

Of course, just because owning a car is difficult doesn't mean not having a car is easy. What are the practical factors to consider? We're getting there...

This is where the rubber meets the road.

Do cars make some people happy? Sure. [There's plenty of evidence of that across DFW.](https://www.instagram.com/carsandcoffee_dallas/?hl=en)

Do you need a car to be happy? Objectively, no. There is no mention of cars in either [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) or in [Max-Neef's taxonomy of fundamental human needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max-Neef%27s_Fundamental_human_needs). 

Are there people in Dallas happy without a car? Yes. First of all, I'm not exaggerating when I say the last two years without a car have been the happiest, healthiest, and most satisfying years of my life. I wouldn't say letting go of my car was the sole reason, but I can honestly say it's a big reason.

Secondly, if we say cars are necessary for happiness, what does that say about everyone who can't own or operate a vehicle? Do we dare suggest people with motor impairments have zero means of pursuing happiness in a city like Dallas?

It doesn't take a genius to realize it's not the car that makes us happy but what the car allows us to do that makes us happy.

But therein lies the rub...

> What makes \*you\* happy?
>
> And do you need a car for that?

The question isn't whether you can live in Dallas without a car.

The question is whether your lifestyle requires a car.

If you can't, then you need a car.

Of course, it's not simply a matter of having a positive mental attitude. Otherwise, [the rate of Dallas households with a car](https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-ceo/2018/september/rethinking-dallas-attraction-to-the-automobile/#:~:text=According%20to%20American%20Community%20Survey,metropolitan%20statistical%20areas%20(MSAs).) would be more like 50%, not 95%.

Your likelihood of needing a car is a function of three variables.

* **Infrastructure:** the options provided by the city.
* **Sprawl:** the choices society made from the options available to them.
* **Lifestyle:** the choices you make

# Infrastructure

> The more a city invests in alternatives to driving, the more lifestyle choices are compatible with non-car ownership.
>
> Despite its shortcomings, Dallas is a high-infrastructure city.

Regarding public transit, no city in Texas comes close to Dallas' coverage and variety of modes. The central city comprises pockets of highly walkable neighborhoods, including Bishop Arts, Lowest Greenville, and Uptown. Mockingbird Station is a poster child for Transit-Oriented Development in North Texas. [The Loop](https://theloopdallas.org/) is an ambitious ongoing project to construct a 50-mile cycling trail around the center of Dallas. I'm very hopeful for the Master Bike Plan that the city is currently drafting. [Affordable housing is a big part of the conversation around next year's bond election.](https://www.dallashousingcoalition.com/#:~:text=Dallas%20is%20becoming%20unaffordable.%20The%20median%20income%20in%20Dallas%20is%20%2458%2C200%2C%20and%20the%20average%20home%20price%20is%20%24405%2C000.)

I'm moving from Old East Dallas (a nice walkable area) to Downtown (peak transit and walkability in the city) in October. It may sound rash, but the best advice I can give for anyone moving to Dallas is to find one of these highly walkable and transit-connected neighborhoods and use your savings from not having a car to live there.

# Sprawl

If Dallas already has high infrastructure, why do most people still need cars? There are several factors, but two fundamental reasons:

* Most people don't live or work near the infrastructure.
* The infrastructure is spread thin across large, low-density areas.

> According to their website, DART serves 220,000 passengers every day.
>
> That's a lot of people, but unless that includes you, your chance of meeting any of them is 3% in our 7.6 million metroplex.

This is unfortunate if you leave the geography of your life entirely up to chance:

* You'll need a car to visit 97% of your friends.
* Your job has a 97% chance of requiring a car to commute.
* Your home has a 97% chance of requiring a car to go anywhere.
* There's a 97% chance you'll need to drive to your favorite coffee shop/hangout.

Ninety-seven percent is a practical guarantee. That settles it, right? You definitely need a car in Dallas? Well, this calculus depends on a binary criteria:

***Do you leave the geography of your life entirely up to chance?***

Herein lies both the challenge and opportunity of living in Dallas.

*The bad news:* in a walkable city that isn't oriented around cars, your chance of needing a car to sustain your lifestyle is closer to fifty percent. But in Dallas, you're practically guaranteed to need a car for home, work, and play if you leave those factors to chance.

*The good news:* if you're in a position where you can craft the geography of your life in Dallas (which is especially the case if you're moving in and getting a fresh start here), this city has the ingredients for choosing to live car-light or car-free happily.

Not everybody does. Not everybody has to. Nonetheless, anybody can and many people do, myself included.

Nobody's orbituary reads "died for lack of car." In contrast, [hundreds are killed by cars every year in Dallas alone](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/11/dallas-has-the-second-worst-traffic-fatality-rate-in-the-country/). Cars kill, on average, four people in Dallas every week.

If it weren't for cars, there would be more people actually living in Dallas to begin with. That's no exaggeration: [car-oriented suburbs absorbed the lion share of DFW growth](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/05/dfw-grew-faster-than-any-region-in-the-u-s-last-year-but-dallas-didnt-make-up-its-losses/) while the City of Dallas was the only city to have a net loss in population during the pandemic. One principal reason for our slow growth is [a quarter of our developable land is dedicated to car storage](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2023/03/a-quarter-of-downtown-dallas-is-parking-lots-could-that-change/) for suburban commuters rather than housing for people without cars to live in.

For starters, owning a car is incredibly expensive. Especially in Dallas, [where average insurance premiums are the second highest among Texas cities](https://www.compare.com/auto-insurance/by-state/texas/dallas-car-insurance#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20car,(and%20the%20national%20average).). Whenever I mention how the [cost of car ownership for most people is at least $500 per month](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/auto-loans/total-cost-owning-car), everybody I talk to in Dallas quickly points out that it's closer to $700 or $800 for them.

Car ownership alone costs between 50% and 100% of most people's rent in this city. Imagine everything you could do if you weren't paying double rent every month. You could move to a slightly more expensive but truly walkable neighborhood (which I did). Or you could put those savings towards things you actually enjoy more than being stuck in traffic, like food, concerts, shows, and recreational activities with friends.

[Auto theft in Dallas is at a record high and climbing](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/auto-theft-reports-hitting-new-highs-in-north-texas/), with 13,412 cars and trucks stolen just last year in Dallas alone. Last week, I went out to dinner with three friends and all of them had their car towed, totaled, or both within the last year; only one of the three managed to get their car back and that's who drove the other two that night.

Last January, even without owning a car I too had a car towed when, to my embarrasment, I made a mistake advising where my should park her car on her first day visiting me from Paris. She had borrowed her parents car for the visit, and we had to take a Lyft to the tow yard in South Dallas.

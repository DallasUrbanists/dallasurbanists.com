## Scooter Tips

Before riding an electric scooter for the first time, it's a good idea to read an online [beginner's guide to riding an electric scooter](https://riderguide.com/safety/how-to-ride-an-electric-scooter/).

In addition to buses and trains, you can see the live location of Bird and Superpedestrian scooters using the [GoPass app](https://riderguide.com/safety/how-to-ride-an-electric-scooter/) from DART. At the time of recording, Lime scooters are not shown on the GoPass app.

# DART Ridership Update

TSOs will provide enhanced service on DART’s light rail vehicles and platforms, as well as the Trinity Railway Express (TRE), with a focus on DART Code of Conduct violations and any potential unlawful activities on DART property. The TSOs join the agency’s 252 budgeted DART Police Officers and Fare Enforcement Officers (FEO) in ensuring DART riders have a safe and secure experience.

The TSO program is scheduled to be fully staffed by mid-August, but security officers can already be seen patrolling DART vehicles.

This is the second in a series of posts themed around [National Week Without Driving](https://americawalks.org/campaigns/national-week-without-driving/), a campaign by non-profit [America Walks](https://americawalks.org/) and organized locally by [Dallas Bicycle Coalition](https://dallasbicyclecoalition.org/dallas-bike-coalition) with support from [Better Block](https://www.betterblock.org/).

I owned and drove a car for most of my adult life. After selling my car in January 2022, I initially just wanted to save money and pay off credit cards. I was marginally aware of some health benefits, and I imagined buying a modest car again after one year of my "lifestyle experiment." Almost two years later, I have no intention of buying a car again. I had underestimated the full benefits to my finances, health, social life, and overall well-being.

There are many things we never truly know until we try. You don't need to get rid of your car like I did; chances are you'll still need it when the campaign is over. Challenging yourself to avoid driving by choice for one week will give you a peek at the world of possibilities.

# REASON #1: Rediscover your city by seeing it in new ways

The two drawings below come from [research in Germany](https://www.experi-forschung.de/en/kinder-sollen-kinder-sein-duerfen-auch-auf-dem-schulweg/) wherein young students were asked to draw their trip to school. Children who walk to school drew a more vibrant picture than those driven in a car.

![Two childrens' drawings of their trip to school. The first drawing is by a child driven to school. The second drawing is by a child who walks to school.](https://ucarecdn.com/b3ce4a6e-3d4a-4ff6-95f1-fef339d5a7d9/ "Two childrens' drawings of their trip to school: one was driven to school, the other walked.")

A [study in the United States](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-07/kids-who-get-driven-everywhere-don-t-know-where-they-re-going) by urbanist researcher Donald Appleyard found very similar results:

> Children who had a “windshield perspective” from being driven everywhere weren’t able to accurately draw how the streets in their community connected, whereas children who walked or biked to get around produced detailed and highly accurate maps of their neighborhood street network.

Appleyard followed up with children in a heavy-traffic neighborhood after improvements were made to pedestrian and bike infrastructure. Not only were they able to draw more detailed maps, they were happier with their environment.

"Windshield perspective" is not limited to children; adults are just as susceptible to losing sight of where they are, especially with the ubiquity of Google Maps. In the show Parks & Recreation, city employee [Tom Haverford is banned by court order from using any screens for a week](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxHO9blkhJKiIWftMq2BVVq2ZHK9g_E5yo?si=wt9IkV8x-W-X925b) after he crashes his car while tweeting and driving; the next day he arrives to work an hour-and-a-half late because he "drove around in circles until he saw something familiar." He lived only 3 miles away.

I used to be one of those people who couldn't drive home when my phone dies. Even if I lived only a mile away, I would have been as lost as a stranger in a foreign land. By walking, cycling, and riding public transit everywhere, I feel an intimiate connection with my neighborhood and the people and businesses that inhabit it.

> Many people today have low sense of place. Driving focuses all attention on traveling from point A to point B, but your city exists in the space between.

# REASON #2: Walk more, live healthier

In the book *Walkable City*, author Jeff Speck goes into great detail about the importance of active transportation and "useful walks" in daily life. I highly recommend reading the [excerpt from the book over on Streetsblog USA](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/11/15/walkable-city-10-years-later-cars-make-us-sicker-than-we-thought); below are highlights that stood out to me.

* Being subjected to traffic noise “results in altered blood chemistry and meddles with blood vessel function,” resulting in greater risk of diabetes, heart attacks, and strokes.
* People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33% more likely to report better mental health.
* If someone shifts from a long commute to a walk, their happiness increases as much as if they’d fallen in love.
* A 2021 study found that people who get around more on foot or by bicycle were demonstrably more likely to engage in policy change efforts through writing letters, making phone calls, and/or attending community meetings.
* A 1981 study found that people who live on streets with light car-traffic counted an average of three friends, while people on car-heavy streets averaged 0.9 friends.

In Beijing, the right to buy a car is determined by a lottery. This resulted in a ["naturally randomized experiment":](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-does-owning-a-car-hurt-your-health/?utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+/+Media&utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links) researchers found that after 5 years, the car lottery "winners" gained 22 pounds on average if they were over the age of 50. Though I'm a little over half that age, I've observed a similar accidental experiment in my own life. In my last year before giving up driving, I lost 20 pounds of body fat by working out at the gym 3 times a week. After selling my car, I switched to [the gym of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPUlgSRn6e0); despite not setting foot in a workout gym since*, I haven't gained back a pound.

*(*BTW, please don't take this message the wrong way. If you do go to an actual gym regularly, keep it up!)*

# REASON #3: Avoid injury, save lives

# REASON #4: Save money, shop local

Avoiding driving saves money in two areas: *vehicles expenses* and *spending habits*. 

## Saving from vehicle expenses

\[list obvious stuff: gas, insurance, payments, repairs, etc.]

## Saving from auto-oriented spending habits

\[transportation choices impact spending habits]

\[shopping at big box store miles away VS mom-and-pops store close by]

\[unbundled parking]

# REASON #5: Build resilience

\[draft]

## \[obvious resilience: what happens if your car is in the shop?]

\[draft]

## \[common example: major event and holiday traffic]

[find reddit post on r/Dallas from someone else that was titled something like: *"Does anyone feel like there's nothing worth doing because of traffic?"*] 

## \[less obvious but important example: anecdote of unexpectedly meeting a friend at a coffeebar, getting drinks for cheer, then arguing to prevent him from driving home drunk.]

\[if we had walked or taken the bus, there would have been no danger by drinking with a buddy spontaneously. driving cars limit options and spontaneity, and adds danger to an otherwise harmless situation.]

## \[less obvious but important example: athlete who can't train to full potential because exhaustion makes driving home dangerous.]

\[anecdote about Beryl Gastaldello, French olympic swimmer. Tried living in Frisco to join sports team. When looking for place to rent in Frisco, set maximum drive time of 15 minutes. Cannot drive farther from sports complex due to exhaustion post training. This physical constraint + lack of public transit in Frisco = limited her affordable housing options. Gave up on Frisco after 2 months. ]

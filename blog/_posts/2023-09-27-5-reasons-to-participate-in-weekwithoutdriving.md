This is the second in a series of posts themed around [National Week Without Driving](https://americawalks.org/campaigns/national-week-without-driving/), a campaign by non-profit [America Walks](https://americawalks.org/) and organized locally by [Dallas Bicycle Coalition](https://dallasbicyclecoalition.org/dallas-bike-coalition) with support from [Better Block](https://www.betterblock.org/).

I owned and drove a car for most of my adult life. After selling my car in January 2022, I initially just wanted to save money and pay off credit cards. I was marginally aware of some health benefits, and I imagined buying a modest car again after one year of my "lifestyle experiment." Almost two years later, I have no intention of buying a car again. I had underestimated the full benefits to my finances, health, social life, and overall well-being.

There are many things we never truly know until we try. You don't need to get rid of your car like I did; chances are you'll still need it when the campaign is over. Challenging yourself to avoid driving by choice for one week will give you a peek at the world of possibilities.

# REASON #1: See your city in new ways, rediscover your surroundings

When asked to draw their trip to school, children who walk to school drew a more vibrant picture than those driven in a car. Every student should have the option to walk or bike to school in a safe manner, full stop. (via Margrit Stamm)

I didn't realize that by not driving every day and everywhere, I'd gain new insights and perspectives about the world around me.

> Many people today have low sense of place. Driving focuses all attention on traveling from point A to point B, but your city exists in the space between.

# REASON #2: Walk more, live healthier

> "People who walk 8.6 minutes a day are 33 percent more likely to report better mental health. . .  researchers found that if someone shifts from a long commute to a walk, their happiness increases as much as if they’d fallen in love."

# REASON #3: Avoid injury, save lives

# REASON #4: Save money, shop local

Avoiding driving saves money in two areas: *vehicles expenses* and *spending habits*. 

## Saving from vehicle expenses

\[list obvious stuff: gas, insurance, payments, repairs, etc.]

## Saving from auto-oriented spending habits

\[transportation choices impact spending habits]

\[shopping at big box store miles away VS mom-and-pops store close by]

\[unbundled parking]

# REASON #5: Build resilience

## \[obvious resilience: what happens if your car is in the shop?]

## \[common example: major event and holiday traffic]

[find reddit post on r/Dallas from someone else that was titled something like: *"Does anyone feel like there's nothing worth doing because of traffic?"*] 

## \[less obvious but important example: anecdote of unexpectedly meeting a friend at a coffeebar, getting drinks for cheer, then arguing to prevent him from driving home drunk.]

\[if we had walked or taken the bus, there would have been no danger by drinking with a buddy spontaneously. driving cars limit options and spontaneity, and adds danger to an otherwise harmless situation.]

## \[less obvious but important example: athlete who can't train to full potential because exhaustion makes driving home dangerous.]

\[anecdote about Beryl Gastaldello, French olympic swimmer. Tried living in Frisco to join sports team. When looking for place to rent in Frisco, set maximum drive time of 15 minutes. Cannot drive farther from sports complex due to exhaustion post training. This physical constraint + lack of public transit in Frisco = limited her affordable housing options. Gave up on Frisco after 2 months. ]

> Don't limit your week without driving to replacing your regular trips; consider the places you can go and activities you could enjoy that your car makes impractical or impossible.

# Speak Up for Affordable Housing at City Council

*Wednesday, December 6th, 9:00 AM*

## What’s happening

At this week’s city council meeting, the council will hear recommendations for how to apportion 1.1 billion dollars in the upcoming 2024 capital bond program.

## Why this matters

Early bond proposals allocated $200M toward housing. However, the latest proposal cut that down to $25M. For comparison, [San Antonio](https://communityimpact.com/san-antonio/north-san-antonio/development/2023/03/02/san-antonio-uses-150m-bond-to-increase-affordable-housing-options/) and [Austin](https://www.kxan.com/investigations/austin-voted-for-a-record-housing-bond-heres-where-the-first-20-million-are-going/#:~:text=AUSTIN%20(KXAN)%20%E2%80%94%20Of%20the,are%20on%20council%20agendas%20already.) put $150M and $300M toward housing in their respective bond programs.

# Community Meetings for DART Service Changes

* *Tuesday 6:30 PM @ Grauwyler Recreation Center ([7780 Harry Hines Blvd, Dallas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NGrv4SBisBmymSeX8))*
* *Wednesday 6:30 PM @ South Irving Library ([601 Schultze Dr, Irving](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MevHSCsFBucRmBsq5))*
* *Saturday 10:00 AM @ DART Headquarters / Akard Station ([1401 Pacific Ave, Dallas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zKkK8PnU17tMd9M78))*

## What’s happening

DART is hosting three community meetings at different locations this week to give the public a chance to provide input on several proposed changes in 2024, including three new bus routes, eight modified routes, 15 modified GoLink zones, and increased weekend frequency on all rail lines. You can find plenty of details in the PDF linked below.

[2024 Service Changes and Route 883 Schedule Adjustments \| PDF slide presentation](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/servicechange/pre-public-hearing-community-meetingsnov162023version.pdf?sfvrsn=f34b3bf4_1)

## [](https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/servicechange/pre-public-hearing-community-meetingsnov162023version.pdf?sfvrsn=f34b3bf4_1)Why this matters

Community meetings like these are your best opportunity to talk directly to DART about improvements to bus and train service. These meetings typically have very low turnout; sometimes only 5 other people show up. This means that by just showing up, you have a good chance of influencing future transit service in your area.

## What you can do

* Attend one of the three community meetings this week.
* Attend the final public hearing next Tuesday, December 12th 6:00 PM, at DART Headquarters / Akard Station ([1401 Pacific Ave, Dallas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zKkK8PnU17tMd9M78)).
* Email your feedback to [serviceplanning@dart.org](serviceplanning@dart.org).

# Take 5-Minute Survey for Statewide Active Transportation Plan

*Anytime before deadline on Friday, December 15th*

## What’s happening

TxDOT’s Bicycle & Pedestrian Advisory Committee is developing a statewide plan for improving conditions for bicycling, walking, and other modes that are typically human-powered (such as electric bicycles).

[Statewide Active Transportation Plan \| Social Pinpoint (mysocialpinpoint.com)](https://burnsmcd.mysocialpinpoint.com/txdot-statewide-active-transportation-plan/home/)

## Why this matters

This will be the first active transportation plan in Texas history, and it could be transformational. In 2021, only 3% of people in Dallas walked, biked, or took public transit to work. We have plenty of room for improvement! The more people take the survey, the more we demonstrate our strong desire for a safe, accessible, walkable and bikeable city.

## What you can do

* [Take the 5-minute online survey](https://burnsmcd.mysocialpinpoint.com/txdot-statewide-active-transportation-plan/round-1-survey/) to help TxDOT develop the plan.
* [Pin comments on the interactive statewide map](https://burnsmcd.mysocialpinpoint.com/txdot-statewide-active-transportation-plan/map#/) to identify opportunities and barriers to using active transportation. You can take as much or as little time as you'd like with this option.
